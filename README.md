# Seal Clicker :)

I've always as a kid used to enjoy website games and clicker games alike, so I've decided, as my final project in John Bryce, to try and make a game of that sort.

## Before you start

Make sure that before you start running the website you do the following:

1. In the client file, make sure to run `npm install` before running the frontend: `npm start`

2. In the server file, make sure you download the requirements.txt using pip by typing `pip install -r requirements. txt`

## How to play

In order to play, I tried to make it as comprehensible as I could but I shall include this section just in case.

So, I have included only one account in the database which is simply "admin" for **username** and **password**.

so you click on **My Account** in the navigation feed and type in the user and password.

Or even better! You can sign up and make your very own little username and password :)
